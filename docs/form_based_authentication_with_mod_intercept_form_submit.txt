1. User accesses application's URL: http://app.example.com/hosts
	2. Browser issues HTTP GET request
	   to app.exmple.com for /hosts

		--- GET /hosts --->

				3. Apache runs or hands the request over
				   to application
					4. Application does not find
					   valid session cookie
					5. Application redirects the
					   browser to logon page

	<--- 302 Location /login?back=/hosts ---

		--- GET /login?back=/hosts --->

				7. Apache runs or hands the request over
